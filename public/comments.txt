Project setup:-
# I was not able to run the project on IE11.
# While running yarn for the first time, I was getting network error and had to delete the package-lock.json.


Assumptions:-
# CTA labelled "View deal" are links and would take user to a new page.


Open questions:-
# Difference between sass partials _mediaqueries.scss and _breakpoints.scss?


Decisions:-
# I prefer box-sizing as border-box.
# As I have not seen the designs for the complete website, therefore, I am not sure about the need to introduce CSS grid or any custom grid framework. Grid should only be added, when required.
# The page design has a single icon. Its not efficient to load a large font icon file for a single icon. The existing svg-xml is already an optimized solution.
# For better UX and visual consistency, I am aligning the prices with hotel name and rating. Refer - https://enginess.io/insights/6-principles-design-la-donald-norman .


Mobile best practices:-
# The recommended size of CTA is 44px in-order to capture thumb clicks.
# Http calls should be minimized.
# Mobiles can be used in both left hand and right hand. CTAs should span across screen to facilitate the right hand and the left hand usage.


Semantic mark-up for main/index.twig. I guess, the melody framework is not allowing me to change the tags. Therefore, I have added the 'role' attribute for screen readers and web crawlers.
<main>
    <article class="centerwrapper">
        <ul class="hotel-list">
            {% for item in items %}
                <li class="hotel-item-wrapper" key="item{{loop.index}}">
                    {% mount '../item' as 'item#{loop.index}' with {
                        item: item
                    } %}
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </article>
</main>
