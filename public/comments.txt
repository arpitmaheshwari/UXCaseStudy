Open questions?
# Difference between sass partials _mediaqueries.scss and _breakpoints.scss

Decisions:-
# I prefer box-sizing as border-box.
# As I have not seen the designs for all the page, I am not introducing CSS grid or any custom grid framework.
# The page design has a single icon. Its not efficient to load a large font icon file for a single icon. The existing svg-xml is a optimized solution.


Mobile best practices:-
# The recommended size of CTA is 44px in-order to capture thumb clicks.
# In portrait mode, the CTAs should be span across page to facilitate left hand and right hand usage.
