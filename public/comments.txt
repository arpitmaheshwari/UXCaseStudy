Open questions?
# Difference between sass partials _mediaqueries.scss and _breakpoints.scss?
# Why has developer decided to use font-sizes in pixels?


Decisions:-
# I prefer box-sizing as border-box.
# As I have not seen the designs for the complete website, I am not introducing CSS grid or any custom grid framework. Grid should only be added, if required
# The page design has a single icon. Its not efficient to load a large font icon file for a single icon. The existing svg-xml is already an optimized solution.
# For better UX and visual consistency, I am aligning the prices with heading and rating. Refer - https://enginess.io/insights/6-principles-design-la-donald-norman


Mobile best practices:-
# The recommended size of CTA is 44px in-order to capture thumb clicks.
# In portrait mode, the CTAs should be span across page to facilitate left hand and right hand usage.
# Http calls should be minimized. So, no web fonts and font icons.


Semantic mark-up for main/index.twig. I believe melody framework is not allowing me to change tags.
<main>
    <article class="centerwrapper">
        <ul class="hotel-list">
            {% for item in items %}
                <li class="hotel-item-wrapper" key="item{{loop.index}}">
                    {% mount '../item' as 'item#{loop.index}' with {
                        item: item
                    } %}
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </article>
</main>
