# Welcome to our Case Study

Our beloved Desktop Only Departmentâ„¢ has developed a prototype of our new Hotel Item. Unfortunately the code does not quite meet our standards.

We would like you to change / recreate that item as a responsive element. Along the way you might encounter some legacy code, pitfalls, and other things that seem not quite right, feel free to work on improving those (or write down what improvements could / should be done in the comments.txt file).

Please don't invest more than 4-6 hours on this case study and remember that it should be fun.

## **Getting Started**

We're using our internal JavaScript framework, Melody, for this project.
You'll need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) setup and working on your machine.

Once you have that up and running, you can execute the following commands run the project.
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

## **Before you submit**
Please make sure to not package the `node_modules` directory in your zip file. We don't need it to run your project.
